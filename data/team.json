The applications examined focus primarily on natural hazard risk assessment and mitigation with emphasis on earthquake and hurricane hazards. The relevant problems currently investigated extend to protection of base-isolated structures against near-field ground motions, life-cycle cost estimation and optimization for civil engineering structures, protection of critical isolated building contents, selection of ground-motion models for efficient description of seismic hazard and real-time estimation of hurricane surge and wave risk. Applications related to large-scale optimization of grids of offshore turbnes or wave-energy conversion devices and to development of an automated decision support system for optimal monitoring and maintenance of infrastructure systems, are also currently examined.","email":"jjw@nd.edu","phone":"574-631-6475","profile":"https://engineering.nd.edu/profiles/jwesterink","photo":"westerink.jpg"},{"firstname":"Martyn","lastname":"Clark","organization":"University of Saskatchewan (Canada)","title":"Professor","department":"Centre for Hydrology and Coldwater Laboratory","interest":"Martyn’s research focuses in three main areas: (i) the development and evaluation of process-based hydrologic models; (ii) understanding the sensitivity of water resources to climate variability and change; and (iii) developing the next generation streamflow forecasting systems.","email":"martyn.clark@usask.ca","phone":"","profile":"https://water.usask.ca/about/profiles/people/martyn-clark.php#AcademicBackground","photo":"clark.jpg"},{"firstname":"Hua","lastname":"Du","organization":"World Bank","title":"Energy Specialist","department":"","interest":"","email":"","phone":"","profile":"","photo":""}]
